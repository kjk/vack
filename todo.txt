Things to do:
* vack cmd-line executable that invokes VisualAck if needed
* 'Move to Application folder' http://www.potionfactory.com/node/251
* do search
* remember list of all searches (will results?)
* show list of recent searches in the NSTableView
* show search results in a nice way
* build test harness to simulate ack. Will need to change the way tests are
  executed in the harness. Currently invocation looks like:
  perl -T ./capture-stderr stderr.log \.\/ack \-\-noenv Sue \-1 \-h \-\-text t\/text
  i.e. ack must be perl file. I would have to modify capture-stderr and run_ack_with_stderr
  in Util.pm. Alternatively, I can modify test harness to capture executed commands
  and write another tool that runs those commands with ack and the same commands
  with vack and verifies that the results are the same

Done:
* (2009-10-07) FileLineIterator
* (2009-10-02) list of default dirs to ignore from ack
* (2009-10-02) interpret and observe --ignore-dir=$dir and --no-ignore-dir=$dir cmd line arguments
* (2009-10-01) started on scaning files
* (2009-09-23) started on vack cmd-line program
* (2009-09-23) understanding ack test suite
* (2009-09-22) imported ack test suite
* (2009-09-21) disable search button if search term or dir is not yet selected
* (2009-09-21) initial state of search directory (~)
* (2009-09-18) started the project
