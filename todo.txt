To do before first public release:
* more tests

Things to do:
* when printing matched file names, do it relative to the directory being
  searched
* analyze stats from auto-updates
* 'Move to Application folder' http://www.potionfactory.com/node/251
* a different way to show results, using HTML, like ack textmate bundle
* add scripting so that I can implement launching gui from vack even when gui is already running
* handle multiple search locations (search_options.search_loc needs to be a list)
* build test harness to simulate ack. Will need to change the way tests are
  executed in the harness. Currently invocation looks like:
  perl -T ./capture-stderr stderr.log \.\/ack \-\-noenv Sue \-1 \-h \-\-text t\/text
  i.e. ack must be perl file. I would have to modify capture-stderr and run_ack_with_stderr
  in Util.pm. Alternatively, I can modify test harness to capture executed commands
  and write another tool that runs those commands with ack and the same commands
  with vack and verifies that the results are the same
* detect if outputing to screen or not and based on that set the default flag
  about wheter or not to show colored output; this can be over-written with
  --[no-][color|colour]
* parse ack config file for compatibility
* even nicer way to show recent searches (header like in xcode's startup screen recent projects list)
* write textmate bundle (based on ack textmate bundle) and automatically install it if
  TextMate is detected on the computer
* launch an editor with a given file directly from the the app
* allow multiple search windows at the same time?

Maybe:
* multi-threaded search (assuming we're CPU bound on searches, not I/O bound)
* search large files (bigger than, say, 1MB) at the end (to improve user experience)
* even more sophisticated file encoding detection (e.g. in html files parse
  metadata about charset; there's code in mozilla somewhere)

Days: 31

Done:

2009-12-28
 * add about box with credit link for the icon
 * bump version to 0.3

2009-12-23
 * proper pluralization of search status string
 * in results view show that a directory/file doesn't exist
 * skip the files that we shouldn't be searching

2009-12-22
 * vack doesn't work if we don't provide starting directory
 * at the top of search results window, show "searching for 'xxx' in 'xxx' text
 * a way to stop search (e.g. when user press a button in the ui). Possibly by
   returning BOOL from delegate methods, returning NO would mean "stop"
 * handle search and directory text fields in results window

2009-12-18
 * add a button that launches website

2009-12-17
 * launch gui from vack using Launch Services instead of fork()
 * detect utf encodings in files that have bom
 * fix search from ui by handling searching in absolute paths
 * use bold font for showing match in the string

2009-12-16
 * we would stop working after a number of files searched because we were keeping
   open file descriptors for too long

2009-12-13
 * make search results be NSOutlineView with collapsible per-file entries
 * stop search when closing a window while search is in progress
 * limit the length of the line to a reasonable size
 * when started as a .app don't go to results page

2009-12-12
 * start work on launch VisualAck from vack
 * increase the size of recent searches table view row to fit 2 lines
   (in preparation for displaying it in a nicer way)
 * launch UI from vack if '-' argument was given
 * before trying to create vack link, show a dialog explaining that (like google app engine runtime)
 * pressing enter in recent search list does something weird (hides the window)
 * indicate that entered directory doesn't exist + live validation while the user types
 * a better indication that there were no results found (overlay a view saying "No results found")
 * make 'New Search' menu item enabled only if window is not visible
 * when launched with cmd-line arguments, go straight to search view

2009-12-10
 * don't add duplicate items to recent searches
 * swap views in one window instead of using two windows
 * move recentSearches logic to SearchWindowController
 * better colors for highlighting lines, line numbers
 * show search stats at the bottom view (searched, skiped files, skipped directories)
 * add indifinite search progress indicator
 * add another delegate method to indicate end of searche

2009-12-09:
 * basic highlighting of search results in UI

2009-12-07
 * when recent search selected - copy data to text fields
 * when recent search double-clicked - start the search
 * change the search text field to NSSearchField

2009-12-04
 * remembering recent searches
 * allow tabbing between fields in search window
 * when closing search results window, show search window
 * open search results window in the same place where search window was
 * show recent searches in SearchWindow

2009-12-03
 * search should be done in a background threaded

2009-12-02
 * start on showing search results

2009-12-01
 * send number of searches with Sparkle updates
 * increase number of searches from within vack
 * started on showing search results

2009-11-29
 * fighting with Sparkle to enable sending profile and uniqueId

2009-11-26:
 * sumbit crash reports to a website
 * if doesn't exist, create link /usr/local/bin/vack to wherever vack lives

2009-11-24:
 * work on submitting crash reports to a website

2009-11-22:
 * UserVoice page for VisualAck
 * write a simple web page about the program
 * build script
 * auto-updates with Sparkle

2009-11-10
 * limit what is searched if there are files/directories given on cmd-line
 * support for multiple matches on one line

2009-11-03
 * notify delegate about matches; show filename colored; show matches
  colored
 * improve FileSearchProtocol; parse search term and search location 
    from cmd-line args

2009-10-24
 * start on FileSearchIterator
 * better tests for [FileLineIterator getNextLine] that also check content
 * fixed [FileLineIterator getNextLine]

2009-10-23
 * work on unit tests for FileLineIterator

2009-10-08
 * started on loc.py

2009-10-07
 * FileLineIterator

2009-10-02
 * list of default dirs to ignore from ack
 * interpret and observe --ignore-dir=$dir and --no-ignore-dir=$dir cmd line arguments

2009-10-01
 * started on scaning files

2009-09-23
 * started on vack cmd-line program
 * understanding ack test suite

2009-09-22
