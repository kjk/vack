Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobbie thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobbie sang the blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
Holdin' Bobbie's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

    Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
    Nothin' don't mean nothin' if it ain't free
    And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when she sang the blues
    Feeling good was good enough for me
    Good enough for me and my Bobbie McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Bobbie shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather and everything we done
Bobbie baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She's looking for that home and I hope she finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holding Bobbie's body next to mine

    Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
    Nothin' don't mean nothin' if it ain't free
    And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when she sang the blues
    Feeling good was good enough for me
    Good enough for me and my Bobbie McGee
